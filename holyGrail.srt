It could grip it by the husk.

It's not a question
of where he grips it.

Hello, stuffy English knights

the brain of a duck, you know.

So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

How dare you profane this
place with your presence?

I command you, in the name
of the knights of Camelot,

to open the doors of
this sacred castle,

to this sacred castle!
